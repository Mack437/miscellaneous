    "home_documentation_content": "Many banks around the world have come to accept the importance of blockchain technology. In fact, a good number of banks in the U.S, India and Japan have already started using the technology. \n  Because banks generally employ the smart contract concept, NEM’s platform which is asset-friendly can be used to settle any asset. In settling assets, speed, security, and reliability are very important to a mainstream institution which is what this crypto offers. \n NEM addresses these issues by repackaging its blockchain into a rivate chain and presenting it as Mijin. \n NEM crypto is also applicable in the technology world. Unlike Bitcoin and Dogecoin which use mining to increase the number of coins, XEM uses something called ‘harvesting’. In this process, blocks are generated and a person is rewarded for work contributed using transaction fees. Every block has a certain number of transactions which attract an unknown amount of fees.",

In order to harvest, accounts must hold a minimum of 10’000 XYM. \n Node owners with insufficient balance can benefit from delegated harvesting and split the harvesting rewards with an account providing the required minimum balance.
